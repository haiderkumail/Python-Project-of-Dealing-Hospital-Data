Explanation of Key Sections:

Data Reading: The read_csv and read_txt functions handle reading the hospital data and disease data, respectively.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: The function calculates the cosine similarity only if valid data is available.
Variance Calculation: Variance is calculated based on cancer admissions data extracted from the TXT file.
Structured Output: The results are printed clearly with headers to identify each output section.

Note:

Ensure your CSV and TXT files are correctly formatted to avoid reading errors.
The cosine similarity should not be zero if both input lists have meaningful values. If they are still zero, check the content of the files for valid data.
If any issues persist, please verify the data in your CSV and TXT files and share any specific details or examples if needed.

Run Code:

Open the "python.py" file in any ide or code editor and run it simply. Just keep one thing that the CSV and TXT file should be in
the same directory where your "python.py" file is present.
